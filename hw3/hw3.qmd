In this exercise, we use tidyverse (ggplot2, dplyr, etc) to explore the [MIMIC-IV](https://mimic.mit.edu/docs/iv/) data introduced in [homework 1](https://ucla-biostat-203b.github.io/2024winter/hw/hw1/hw1.html) and to build a cohort of ICU stays.

## Q1. Visualizing patient trajectory

Visualizing a patient's encounters in a health care system is a common task in clinical data analysis. In this question, we will visualize a patient's ADT (admission-discharge-transfer) history and ICU vitals in the MIMIC-IV data.

### Q1.1 ADT history

A patient's ADT history records the time of admission, discharge, and transfer in the hospital. This figure shows the ADT history of the patient with `subject_id` 10001217 in the MIMIC-IV data. The x-axis is the calendar time, and the y-axis is the type of event (ADT, lab, procedure). The color of the line segment represents the care unit. The size of the line segment represents whether the care unit is an ICU/CCU. The crosses represent lab events, and the shape of the dots represents the type of procedure. The title of the figure shows the patient's demographic information and the subtitle shows top 3 diagnoses.

![](10001217_adt.png)
Do a similar visualization for the patient with `subject_id` 10013310 using ggplot.

Hint: We need to pull information from data files `patients.csv.gz`, `admissions.csv.gz`, `transfers.csv.gz`, `labevents.csv.gz`, `procedures_icd.csv.gz`, `diagnoses_icd.csv.gz`, `d_icd_procedures.csv.gz`, and `d_icd_diagnoses.csv.gz`. For the big file `labevents.csv.gz`, use the Parquet format you generated in Homework 2. For reproducibility, make the Parquet folder `labevents_pq` available at the current working directory `hw3`, for example, by a symbolic link. Make your code reproducible.

### Q1.2 ICU stays

ICU stays are a subset of ADT history. This figure shows the vitals of the patient `10001217` during ICU stays. The x-axis is the calendar time, and the y-axis is the value of the vital. The color of the line represents the type of vital. The facet grid shows the abbreviation of the vital and the stay ID.

***Answer***

Import the necessary data: chartevents
```{r eval = TRUE}
sid_chart <- arrow::open_dataset("~/chartevents_pq") %>%
  filter(subject_id == sid) %>%
  collect() %>%
  print(width = Inf)

sid_ditems <- read_csv("~/mimic/icu/d_items.csv.gz") %>%
  filter(abbreviation %in% c("HR", "NBPd", "NBPs", "RR", "Temperature F")) %>%

library(ggplot2)
library(scales)
library(dplyr)

# Assuming dit_ICU_stays is already loaded and contains the correct data

# Make sure the 'value' column is numeric
dit_ICU_stays <- dit_ICU_stays %>%
  mutate(value = as.numeric(value)) 

# Plot the graph
ggplot(data = dit_ICU_stays, aes(x = charttime, y = value, color = abbreviation)) + 
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  facet_grid(abbreviation ~ stay_id, scales = "free") + # both axes have free scales
  labs(title = paste("Patient", sid, "ICU stays - Vitals"),
       x = "",
       y = "") +
  theme(legend.title = element_blank(),

  scale_y_continuous(labels = comma)
```
## Q2. ICU stays

`icustays.csv.gz` (<https://mimic.mit.edu/docs/iv/modules/icu/icustays/>) contains data about Intensive Care Units (ICU) stays. The first 10 lines are
```{bash}
zcat < ~/mimic/icu/icustays.csv.gz | head
```

### Q2.1 Ingestion

Import `icustays.csv.gz` as a tibble `icustays_tble`. 

```{r eval = TRUE}

icustays_tble <- read_csv("~/mimic/icu/icustays.csv.gz") %>%
  collect() %>%
  print(width = Inf)
```

### Q2.2 Summary and visualization

How many unique `subject_id`? Can a `subject_id` have multiple ICU stays? Summarize the number of ICU stays per `subject_id` by graphs.

***Answer***

```{r eval = TRUE}
# the numer of unique subject_id
icustays_tble %>%
  count(subject_id) %>%
  nrow()
```
There are 50920 unique subject_id with sid 10013310.

```{r eval = TRUE}
icustays_sum <- icustays_tble %>%
  group_by(subject_id) %>%
  summarize(n_icu_stays = n_distinct(stay_id)) %>%
  collect() %>%
  print(width = Inf)
```
Based on the summary, a `subject_id` can have multiple ICU stays.
```{r eval = TRUE}
# the number of ICU stays per `subject_id` by graphs
icustays_plot <- ggplot(icustays_sum, aes(x = n_icu_stays)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "skyblue", color = "black") +
  labs(x = "Number of ICU Stays", y = "Count", 
       title = "Distribution of ICU Stays per Subject") +
  theme_minimal()

print(icustays_plot)
```
Summarize the number of ICU stays per subject_id by graphs.

## Q3. `admissions` data

Information of the patients admitted into hospital is available in `admissions.csv.gz`. See <https://mimic.mit.edu/docs/iv/modules/hosp/admissions/> for details of each field in this file. The first 10 lines are
```{bash}
zcat < ~/mimic/hosp/admissions.csv.gz | head
```

### Q3.1 Ingestion

Import `admissions.csv.gz` as a tibble `admissions_tble`.

***Answer***
```{r eval = TRUE}
admissions_tble <- read_csv("~/mimic/hosp/admissions.csv.gz") %>%
  collect() %>%
  print(admissions_tble, width = Inf)
```

### Q3.2 Summary and visualization

Summarize the following information by graphics and explain any patterns you see.

- number of admissions per patient  
- admission hour (anything unusual?)  
- admission minute (anything unusual?)  
- length of hospital stay (from admission to discharge) (anything unusual?)  

According to the [MIMIC-IV documentation](https://mimic.mit.edu/docs/iv/about/concepts/#date-shifting), 

> All dates in the database have been shifted to protect patient confidentiality. Dates will be internally consistent for the same patient, but randomly distributed in the future. Dates of birth which occur in the present time are not true dates of birth. Furthermore, dates of birth which occur before the year 1900 occur if the patient is older than 89. In these cases, the patient’s age at their first admission has been fixed to 300.

***Answer***
```{r eval = TRUE}
library(lubridate) # load package if you haven't already
# summary of admissions
 admissions_summary <- admissions_tble %>%
  mutate(admission_hour = hour(admittime),
         admission_minute = minute(admittime),
         dischtime = as.POSIXct(dischtime),
         admission_length = dischtime - admittime) %>%
  mutate(admission_length_seconds = as.numeric(admission_length)) %>%
  collect()

# Print admissions summary
print(admissions_summary, width = Inf)
```

```{r eval = TRUE}
# number of admissions per patient
admissions_summary %>%
  count(subject_id) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = n)) +
  geom_bar() +
  labs(x = "Number of Admissions", y = "Number of Patients", 
       title = "Number of Admissions per Patient")

# admission hour
admissions_summary %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = admission_hour)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 24) + # Assuming admission_hour is a 24-hour format
  labs(x = "Admission Hour", y = "Count", 
       title = "Distribution of Admission Hours")

# admission minute
admissions_summary %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = admission_minute)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 60) + # Assuming admission_minute ranges from 0 to 59
  labs(x = "Admission Minute", y = "Count", 
       title = "Distribution of Admission Minutes")

# length of hospital stay
#second to day

admissions_summary %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = admission_length_seconds)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = (max(admissions_summary$admission_length_seconds) - min(admissions_summary$admission_length_seconds)) / 30) +
  labs(x = "Length of Stay (Seconds)", y = "Count", 
       title = "Distribution of Length of Hospital Stay")
```
explanation of patterns:

- The number of admissions per patient is right-skewed, with most patients having only one admission.
- The distribution of admission hours is relatively uniform, with a slight increase in the morning hours.
- The distribution of admission minutes is relatively uniform, with a slight increase at the 0th minute.
- The distribution of length of hospital stay is right-skewed, with most stays being less than 100,000 seconds (about 27.8 hours).

In conclusion, the patterns observed in the data are consistent with what we would expect in a hospital setting. The distribution of admission hours and minutes is relatively uniform, which is expected given that patients can be admitted at any time of the day. The distribution of length of hospital stay is right-skewed, with most stays being relatively short, which is also expected given that most patients are admitted for short-term care.

## Q4. `patients` data

Patient information is available in `patients.csv.gz`. See <https://mimic.mit.edu/docs/iv/modules/hosp/patients/> for details of each field in this file. The first 10 lines are
```{bash}
zcat < ~/mimic/hosp/patients.csv.gz | head
```

### Q4.1 Ingestion

Import `patients.csv.gz` (<https://mimic.mit.edu/docs/iv/modules/hosp/patients/>) as a tibble `patients_tble`.

***Answer***
```{r eval = TRUE}
patients_tble <- read_csv("~/mimic/hosp/patients.csv.gz") %>%
  collect() %>%
  print(patients_tble, width = Inf)
```

### Q4.2 Summary and visualization

Summarize variables `gender` and `anchor_age` by graphics, and explain any patterns you see.

#### Answer

```{r eval = TRUE}
# Summary statistics for gender
gender_summary <- patients_tble %>%
  count(gender) 

# Summary statistics for anchor_age
anchor_age_summary <- patients_tble %>%
  summarize(mean_anchor_age = mean(anchor_age),
            median_anchor_age = median(anchor_age),
            min_anchor_age = min(anchor_age),
            max_anchor_age = max(anchor_age))

gender_plot <- ggplot(gender_summary, aes(x = gender, y = n)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "skyblue") +
  labs(x = "Gender", y = "Count", 
       title = "Gender Distribution of Patients") +
  theme_minimal()

print(gender_plot)

anchor_age_plot <- ggplot(patients_tble, aes(x = anchor_age)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5, fill = "skyblue", color = "black") +
  labs(x = "Anchor Age", y = "Count", 
       title = "Distribution of Anchor Age") +
  theme_minimal()

print(anchor_age_plot)
```


## Q5. Lab results

`labevents.csv.gz` (<https://mimic.mit.edu/docs/iv/modules/hosp/labevents/>) contains all laboratory measurements for patients. The first 10 lines are
```{bash}
zcat < ~/mimic/hosp/labevents.csv.gz | head
```

`d_labitems.csv.gz` (<https://mimic.mit.edu/docs/iv/modules/hosp/d_labitems/>) is the dictionary of lab measurements. 
```{bash}
zcat < ~/mimic/hosp/d_labitems.csv.gz | head
```

We are interested in the lab measurements of creatinine (50912), potassium (50971), sodium (50983), chloride (50902), bicarbonate (50882), hematocrit (51221), white blood cell count (51301), and glucose (50931). Retrieve a subset of `labevents.csv.gz` that only containing these items for the patients in `icustays_tble`. Further restrict to the last available measurement (by `storetime`) before the ICU stay. The final `labevents_tble` should have one row per ICU stay and columns for each lab measurement.

![](labevents_tble.png)


Hint: Use the Parquet format you generated in Homework 2. For reproducibility, make `labevents_pq` folder available at the current working directory `hw3`, for example, by a symbolic link.

```{r eval = TRUE}

d_labitems <- read_csv("~/mimic/hosp/d_labitems.csv.gz", col_types = cols(
  label = col_character(),
  fluid = col_character(),
  category = col_character(),
  itemid = col_double()  # specify itemid as double to avoid type mismatch during join
))
print(d_labitems, width = Inf)
icustays_tble_Q5 <- icustays_tble %>%
  mutate(subject_id = as.character(subject_id))
```

```{r eval = TRUE}
library(lubridate)
library(tidyr)
# Read in the lab items data, specifying column types
d_labitems <- read_csv("~/mimic/hosp/d_labitems.csv.gz", col_types = cols(
  label = col_character(),
  fluid = col_character(),
  category = col_character(),
  itemid = col_double() 
))
print(d_labitems, width = Inf)

# Convert subject_id to character to ensure it matches the other table's type
icustays_tble_Q5 <- icustays_tble %>%
  mutate(subject_id = as.character(subject_id))

# Open the lab events dataset and filter for relevant data
labevents_tble <- arrow::open_dataset("~/labevents.parquet", 
                                      format = "parquet") %>%
  select(subject_id, itemid, valuenum, storetime) %>%
  mutate(subject_id = as.character(subject_id), # Ensure subject_id is character
         itemid = as.numeric(itemid)) %>% # Convert itemid to numeric
  filter(subject_id %in% icustays_tble_Q5$subject_id,
         itemid %in% c(50912, 50971, 50983, 50902, 
                       50882, 51221, 51301, 50931)) %>%
  collect() %>%
  left_join(icustays_tble_Q5, by = "subject_id") %>%
  left_join(d_labitems, by = "itemid") %>%
  select(subject_id, stay_id, itemid, valuenum, storetime, intime, label) %>%
  filter(storetime < intime) %>%
  group_by(subject_id, stay_id, itemid) %>%
  slice_max(order_by = storetime, n = 1) %>%
  ungroup()

# Reshape the data to a wide format
labevents_final_tble <- labevents_tble %>%
  select(subject_id, stay_id, label, valuenum) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = label, values_from = valuenum,
              values_fn = list(valuenum = last)) 

labevents_final_tble <- labevents_final_tble %>%
  rename_with(tolower)

# Rename the 'white blood cells' column to 'wbc'
labevents_final_tble <- labevents_final_tble %>%
  rename(wbc = 'white blood cells')

# Display the final table
labevents_final_tble
```

## Q6. Vitals from charted events

`chartevents.csv.gz` (<https://mimic.mit.edu/docs/iv/modules/icu/chartevents/>) contains all the charted data available for a patient. During their ICU stay, the primary repository of a patient’s information is their electronic chart. The `itemid` variable indicates a single measurement type in the database. The `value` variable is the value measured for `itemid`. The first 10 lines of `chartevents.csv.gz` are
```{bash}
zcat < ~/mimic/icu/chartevents.csv.gz | head
```

`d_items.csv.gz` (<https://mimic.mit.edu/docs/iv/modules/icu/d_items/>) is the dictionary for the `itemid` in `chartevents.csv.gz`. 
```{bash}
zcat < ~/mimic/icu/d_items.csv.gz | head
```

We are interested in the vitals for ICU patients: heart rate (220045), systolic non-invasive blood pressure (220179), diastolic non-invasive blood pressure (220180), body temperature in Fahrenheit (223761), and respiratory rate (220210). Retrieve a subset of `chartevents.csv.gz` only containing these items for the patients in `icustays_tble`. Further restrict to the first vital measurement within the ICU stay. The final `chartevents_tble` should have one row per ICU stay and columns for each vital measurement. 

![](chartevents_tble.png)

Hint: Use the Parquet format you generated in Homework 2. For reproducibility, make `chartevents_pq` folder available at the current working directory, for example, by a symbolic link.

***Answer***
```{r eval = TRUE}
# Import chartevents

# Avoid data overlap
icustays_tble_Q6 <- icustays_tble %>%
  mutate(subject_id = as.character(subject_id))

chartevents_tble <- chartevents_tble %>%

  summarise(value = first(value, order_by = charttime), .groups = "drop")

# Pivot the table wider and then rename the columns directly
chartevents_final_tble <- chartevents_firstm %>%
  pivot_wider(
    id_cols = c(subject_id, stay_id),
    names_from = itemid,
    values_from = value
  ) %>%
  rename(
    heart_rate = `220045`,
    non_invasive_blood_pressure_systolic = `220179`,
    non_invasive_blood_pressure_diastolic = `220180`,
    temperature_fahrenheit = `223761`,
    respiratory_rate = `220210`
  )

# Display the final table
print(chartevents_final_tble)
```

## Q7. Putting things together

Let us create a tibble `mimic_icu_cohort` for all ICU stays, where rows are all ICU stays of adults (age at `intime` >= 18) and columns contain at least following variables

- all variables in `icustays_tble`  
- all variables in `admissions_tble`  
- all variables in `patients_tble`
- the last lab measurements before the ICU stay in `labevents_tble` 
- the first vital measurements during the ICU stay in `chartevents_tble`

The final `mimic_icu_cohort` should have one row per ICU stay and columns for each variable.

## Q8. Exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Summarize the following information about the ICU stay cohort `mimic_icu_cohort` using appropriate numerics or graphs:

- Length of ICU stay `los` vs demographic variables (race, insurance, marital_status, gender, age at intime)

- Length of ICU stay `los` vs the last available lab measurements before ICU stay

- Length of ICU stay `los` vs the average vital measurements within the first hour of ICU stay

- Length of ICU stay `los` vs first ICU unit


***Answer***

- Length of ICU stay `los` vs demographic variables (race, insurance, marital_status, gender, age at intime)
```{r eval = TRUE}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

demographic_func <- function(data, demographic) {
  data %>%
    group_by(!!sym(demographic)) %>%
    summarize(mean_los = mean(los, na.rm = TRUE), 
              median_los = median(los, na.rm = TRUE),
              n = n()) %>%
    ungroup()
}
# Function to create plots for categorical demographics

    geom_point(alpha = 0.5, color = fill_color) +
    geom_smooth(method = "loess", color = "blue", se = FALSE) +
    theme_minimal() +
    labs(title = paste("Average Length of ICU Stay by", demographic),

}

# Generate summaries

                                    "gender", "anchor_age"), function(demo) {

# Assign names to the list based on demographics for easier access

Use ggplot with only four main race categories and an "Other" category for less frequent:
```{r eval = TRUE}
plot_categorical <- function(data, demographic) {
  # Collapse less frequent categories into 'Other'
  data <- data %>%
    mutate(!!demographic := ifelse(!(!!sym(demographic) %in% c("WHITE", "BLACK/AFRICAN AMERICAN", "HISPANIC OR LATINO", "ASIAN")), "OTHER", !!sym(demographic)))

  # Plot
  ggplot(data, aes_string(x = demographic, y = "mean_los", 
                          fill = demographic)) +
    geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
    theme_minimal() +
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1, size = 7, 
                                     face = "plain"), 
          plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),
          axis.title = element_text(size = 10)) +
    labs(title = paste("Length of ICU Stay (los) vs", demographic),
         x = demographic,
         y = "Length of Stay (los)") +
    scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Paired") 
}

# Generate summary for race
race_summary <- demographic_func(mimic_icu_cohort, "race")

# Create plot for race
race_plot <- plot_categorical(race_summary, "race")

# Print the race plot
print(race_plot)
```


Use summary statistics to describe the average length of ICU stay by demographic variables. For example, you can calculate the mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum length of stay for each demographic category. Here's an example of how you might do this using the dplyr package in R:
```{r eval = TRUE}
race_stats <- race_summary %>%
  group_by(race) %>%
  summarise(
    count = n(),
    mean = mean(mean_los, na.rm = TRUE),
    min = min(mean_los, na.rm = TRUE),
    max = max(mean_los, na.rm = TRUE)
  )

# Print the race statistics
print(race_stats)
```
Description: The plots show the average length of ICU stay by demographic variables. The first four plots are bar plots for categorical, The plot 1 is Average Length of ICU Stay vs Insurance by bar chart, it shows that the average length of ICU stay is similar across different insurance types. The plot 2 is Average Length of ICU Stay vs Marital Status by bar chart, it shows that the average length of ICU stay is similar across different marital status. The plot 3 is Average Length of ICU, it shows that the average length of ICU stay is similar. The plot 4 is Average Length of ICU Stay vs Age by scatter plot, it shows that the average length of ICU stay is similar across different age groups.  THe plot 5 is Average Length of ICU Stay vs Race by bar chart, it shows that the average length of ICU stay is similar across on 5 race categories. And there is a summary statistics for race categories, it shows the average length of ICU stay, sd, min, and max for each category.

- Length of ICU stay `los` vs the last available lab measurements before ICU stay

```{r eval = TRUE}
# Join the ICU stay data with the last lab measurements
patients_tble <- patients_tble %>%
  mutate(subject_id = as.character(subject_id))
```

```{r eval = TRUE}
icu_last_lab <- mimic_icu_cohort %>%
  mutate(subject_id = as.character(subject_id)) %>%
  left_join(patients_tble, by = "subject_id")

# Reshape the data to long format
data_long <- icu_last_lab %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = c('bicarbonate', 'chloride', 'creatinine', 'glucose', 
                        'potassium', 'sodium', 'hematocrit'),
               names_to = "Lab_measurements",
               values_to = "Value")

# Create a plot with different panels for each lab measurement
ggplot(data_long, aes(x = Value, y = los)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  facet_wrap(~Lab_measurements, scales = "free_x") +
  labs(title = "Los vs Last Lab Measurements",
       x = "Last Lab Measurement",
       y = "Length of Stay in ICU (Los)") +
  theme_minimal()
```

Description: The plot shows the length of ICU stay vs the last available lab measurements before ICU stay. The x-axis represents the last lab measurement value, and the y-axis represents the length of stay in ICU. Each panel represents a different lab measurement. The plot shows that there is no clear relationship between the last lab measurements and the length of ICU stay.

-  Length of ICU stay `los` vs the average vital measurements within the first hour of ICU stay
```{r eval = TRUE}
# Merging
data <- merge(icustays_tble, chartevents_final_tble, 
                       by = c("subject_id", "stay_id"))
```

```{r eval = TRUE}
# Reshaping
data_reshaped <- data %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = c("heart_rate", 
    "non_invasive_blood_pressure_systolic", 
    "non_invasive_blood_pressure_diastolic", 
    "temperature_fahrenheit", 
    "respiratory_rate"),
               names_to = "Vital",
               values_to = "Measurement")
```

```{r eval = TRUE}
ggplot(data_reshaped, aes(x = Measurement, y = los)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.6) + 
  facet_wrap(~Vital, scales = "free_x") + 
  labs(x = "Vital Measurements",
       y = "Length of ICU Stay (los)",
       title = "ICU Stay Length vs First Vital Measurement") +
  theme_bw() + 
  theme(strip.text.x = element_text(size = 10))

```
Description: The plot shows the length of ICU stay vs the average vital measurements within the first hour of ICU stay. The x-axis represents the average vital sign measurement, and the y-axis represents the length of stay in ICU. Each panel represents a different vital sign. The plot shows that there is no clear relationship between the average vital measurements within the first hour of ICU stay and the length of ICU stay.

- Length of ICU stay `los` vs first ICU unit

```{r eval = TRUE}
library(ggplot2)
library(stringr)

# variable transformation
mimic_icu_cohort$first_careunit <- factor(mimic_icu_cohort$first_careunit, 
                                           levels = unique(
                                             mimic_icu_cohort$first_careunit))

# Wraping
mimic_icu_cohort$first_careunit <- str_wrap(mimic_icu_cohort$first_careunit, 
                                            width = 10)

# plotting
plot <- ggplot(mimic_icu_cohort, aes(x = first_careunit, y = los)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(x = "First Care Unit",
       y = "Length of ICU Stay (los)",
       title = "Length of ICU Stay vs First Care Unit") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 0, hjust = 0.5, vjust = 0.5)) 

print(plot)
```
Description: The plot shows the length of ICU stay vs the first ICU unit. The x-axis represents the first care unit, and the y-axis represents the length of stay in ICU. The plot shows that there is no clear relationship between the first care unit and the length of ICU stay. The length of ICU stay varies across different care units, but there is no consistent pattern.
